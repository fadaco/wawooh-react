            Please be aware that we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices
            of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave

          <h3 classNameName="brand-color makeBold">Security</h3>
          <p>
            We take steps to protect our customers’ information against loss or
            theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or
            modification, both online and off-line
          </p>
          <p>
            When our online registration form or order form asks you to enter
            sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is
            encrypted and is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption
            technology. While on a secure page, such as our order form, web browsers
            (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Apple Safari)
            change to “locked” status as opposed to un-locked, or open, status used
            for general internet searches or browsing.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we
            also strive to protect user information off-line. All of our users'
            information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is
            restricted in our offices. Only Associates who need the information to
            perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a Consumer
            Care representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
            information. Furthermore, all Associates are kept up-to-date on our
            security and privacy practices. Our Associates are regularly notified
            and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can
            do to ensure our customers' information is protected.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have questions about our information security practices, contact
            Wawooh Consumer Care.

            provide services you’ve requested, we may communicate with you by either

            code), or if you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to
            provide a way for you to correct, update or remove your personal

        <h3 className="brand-color makeBold">Website and Log Files</h3>
        <p>
          We may collect information automatically as you navigate through the
          site. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP
          addresses and information collected through cookies, web beacons, or and
          other tracking technologies. We use IP addresses to analyze trends,
          administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad
          demographic information for aggregate use. We also may use these
          technologies to collect information about your online activities over
          time and across third-party websites or other online services.
        </p>

        <h3 className="brand-color makeBold">Do Not Track Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Some web browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell
          websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activities
          tracked. These features are not yet uniform across browsers, so this
          site is not currently set up to respond to those signals.
        </p>

        <h3 className="brand-color makeBold">Sharing</h3>

        </p>
        <p>
          We may combine the personal information we collect, such as your order
          information and contact information, with other personally identifiable
          information (such as demographic information and past purchase
          information) available from our records and other sources. This
          information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more
          efficient. It may also be disclosed to and used by our marketing

        <h3 classNameName="brand-color makeBold">Links</h3>
        <p>
          From time to time, Wawooh.com may contain links to other websites.
          Please be aware that we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices
          of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave
          our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website
          that collects personally identifiable information. The privacy policy
          you are currently reading applies solely to information collected by
          wawooh.com.
        </p>

        <h3 classNameName="brand-color makeBold">Security</h3>
        <p>
          We take steps to protect our customers’ information against loss or
          theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or
          modification, both online and off-line
        </p>
        <p>
          When our online registration form or order form asks you to enter
          sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is
          encrypted and is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption
          technology. While on a secure page, such as our order form, web browsers
          (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Apple Safari)
          change to “locked” status as opposed to un-locked, or open, status used
          for general internet searches or browsing.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we
          also strive to protect user information off-line. All of our users'
          information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is
          restricted in our offices. Only Associates who need the information to
          perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a Consumer
          Care representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
          information. Furthermore, all Associates are kept up-to-date on our
          security and privacy practices. Our Associates are regularly notified
          and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can
          do to ensure our customers' information is protected.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have questions about our information security practices, contact
          Wawooh Consumer Care.
